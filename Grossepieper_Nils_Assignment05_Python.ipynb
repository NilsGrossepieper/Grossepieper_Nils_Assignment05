Every logical programming step should be well documented on GitHub with a meaningful commit message, so that other people (e.g., your course instructor) can follow and understand the development history. You can do this either using Shell commands or a Git GUI of your choice."

This API key enables you to perform the GET requests needed throughout this assignment. Even though this API key is not secret per se (it is publicly visible on the API Explorer website), please comply to the common secrecy practices discussed in the lecture and the tutorial: Treat the API key as a secret token. Your API key should neither appear in the code that you are submitting nor in your public GitHub repository."
